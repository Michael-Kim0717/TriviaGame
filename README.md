## Speed Trivia

You are given 10 random questions from random categories to answer.
You have 10 seconds to answer each question and you will be able to see your results at the end of the game.

# Rules/Gameplay

There are no real rules.
When given a question, click the answer that you believe is right.
For every question, you will be scored on whether your answer was correct, incorrect, or unanswered (you fail to answer in the 10 seconds).
There are no life-lines or any hints for these questions, so this will be based purely on your own knowledge.
